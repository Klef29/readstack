# 📚 ReadStack – Book Library App  

ReadStack is a simple React-based Book Library application that allows users to search for books using the **Open Library API** and view results in an interactive interface. The project is designed to help me practice **React fundamentals, React Router, API integration, and Tailwind CSS styling**.

## 🚀 Features Implemented So Far
- ✅ **Navbar** with navigation links (Home, About).  
- ✅ **Search Bar** component to enter book queries.  
- ✅ **Home Page** integrated with the search bar.  
- ✅ **About Page** created with app description + search bar included.  
- ✅ **React Router Setup** for navigation between pages.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **React** (frontend framework)  
- **React Router DOM** (for navigation)  
- **Tailwind CSS** (for styling)  
- **Open Library API** (for fetching books data)

## 📅 Next Steps
- Implement the **Book Details Page** to show more info (author, description, publish date).  
- Improve UI design for search results and make the layout more responsive.  
- Add error handling for searches with no results.  
- Clean and refactor the code for better maintainability.
